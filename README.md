## Technologies Used  

1. **SignalR**  
   - Facilitates real-time communication by establishing a persistent connection between the server and clients.  
   - Supports various transport protocols (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling).  

2. **.Net Core**  
   - Backend framework for API development.  
   - Handles user management, message processing, and SignalR hub integration.  

3. **React**  
   - Frontend framework for creating a dynamic user interface.  
   - Manages state and provides a responsive design for better user experience.

## System Architecture  

1. **Frontend**  
   - Built with React and interacts with SignalR to listen for events and update the UI dynamically.  

2. **Backend**  
   - Developed using .Net Core with a SignalR Hub to manage client connections and message broadcasting.  

3. **Communication**  
   - SignalR ensures a continuous connection between clients and the server for low-latency message delivery.

## Potential Enhancements  

- **Group Messaging**  
  - Add support for group chats with multiple participants.  

- **Message Persistence**  
  - Integrate a database to store messages for historical access.  

- **File Sharing**  
  - Enable users to send images or documents.  

- **Notification System**  
  - Push notifications for incoming messages when users are inactive.
